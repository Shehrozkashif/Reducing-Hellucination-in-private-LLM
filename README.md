# Reducing Hallucination in Private LLMs

**Reducing Hallucination in Private LLM** is an advanced research and development project aimed at addressing the problem of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) used in private environments. The project focuses on techniques and strategies for mitigating false or misleading information generated by LLMs in private settings, with an emphasis on improving the reliability, trustworthiness, and safety of LLMs when deployed in sensitive or controlled environments.

## Project Overview

Hallucination in language models refers to the generation of text that is plausible-sounding but factually incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical. This is a common issue in LLMs, especially when deployed in private, highly specialized, or sensitive environments. The project aims to explore and implement methods for reducing these hallucinations by improving model reliability, incorporating better data curation techniques, and using state-of-the-art verification processes.

By focusing on private settings, the project will offer solutions for better validation and enhanced control over model outputs while maintaining privacy and security.

### Key Goals:
- Implementing real-time verification for generated outputs.
- Reducing hallucinations in private and domain-specific LLM deployments.
- Evaluating and testing techniques like fine-tuning and model supervision.
- Providing tools for better transparency and explanation of model decisions.

## Features

- **Reduced Hallucination**: Employs novel methods for reducing the generation of inaccurate or fabricated information.
- **Real-time Output Verification**: Incorporates tools to validate the responses of the LLM against verified data sources.
- **Private LLM Adaptation**: Focuses on making private LLMs safer, more reliable, and contextually accurate.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Includes mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and tuning of model responses based on feedback and use-case-specific requirements.

## Installation

To get started with **Reducing Hallucination in Private LLM**, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Reducing-Hallucination-in-private-LLM.git
cd Reducing-Hallucination-in-private-LLM
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Set up the environment by configuring the necessary parameters in the `config.json` file. You’ll find default configuration settings in the repository. Edit this file based on your private LLM’s specifics.

## Usage

### Running the Model

After installation, you can start using the LLM with reduced hallucination methods via the provided Python scripts.

#### Example Command:

```bash
python main.py --input "What are the latest advancements in AI?"
```

This command will process the input through the LLM, utilizing the hallucination reduction techniques and outputting the refined, verified result.

#### Interactive Testing

For testing, you can run the provided Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks from the browser and start interacting with the system for hands-on experimentation.

### API Usage (Optional)

If you want to interact with the model programmatically, we also provide a simple API server that can be used to query the LLM model.

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

### Example API Call:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/query' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "question": "What is the capital of France?"
}'
```

The system will respond with the model's verified and refined answer.
